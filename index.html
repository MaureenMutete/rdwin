            <p>Regional Deaf Women Initiative Network is a dedicated organization committed to the empowerment of Deaf
                women and girls in Kenya. RDWIN was founded in 2003 by 3 deaf ladies to address the challenges facing
                deaf women and girls. Registered in 2007, the network has evolved to be a feminist centre of excellence
                that strives to create a supportive and inclusive community where Deaf women and girls can thrive,
                connect, and inspire one another</p>
